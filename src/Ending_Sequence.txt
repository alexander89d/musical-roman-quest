(In the Domus Aurea):

Hello! I, emperor Nero, am always happy to receive music lovers into my presence. You are in for a treat tonight!
But first, let's eat dinner. I hope you like dormouse!
#
OK, let's head to the library together. We can just ride in my chariot since chariots
are allowed on the streets of Rome after sundown. You must be tired from walking all day.
#
(In the Bibliotheca):

This over here is the piece I will be performing tonight. Here, I'll sign a copy and give it to you!

Now, let's head to the theatrum for my breathtaking performance.
#
(In the Theatrum):

(Nero singing):
Rome is great, I am great, isn't everything greaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!
Rome is great, I am great, why is there so much haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate?
Rome is great, I am great, I will sing until very laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate!
#
(3 hours later, Nero is still singing):
Rome is great, I am great, sininging is my faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate!
Now you can go home and celebraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate Neroooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
#
(You think to yourself that this may not have been worth all the hard work to get an audience with Nero,
but you are glad you have met your objective).#
