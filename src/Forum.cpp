 * Program Name: Forum.cpp
 * Author: Alexander Densmore
 * Date: 12/3/18
 * Description: Forum class that is a child of the abstract Space class. Implements the
 * 		Forum (Market). In the Forum, the user can buy various items.
 * 		The user must buy 2 specific items randomly selected
 * 		by the soldier in the Campus Martius (one exensive item and one cheap item).
 *
 * 		Protected data members inherited by Space child classes include the following:
 * 		- Pointers to the Spaces in all 8 directions (north, northeast, east, etc.)
 * 		- A string representing the name of the space
 *		- An int representing the space's number (for use when displaying map of player's
 *		current location)
 *		- A string description of the space
 *		
 *		Item struct is declared as a private member of Forum class.
 *		The Item struct keeps track of the name and price of each item.
 *
 *		Private data members include the following:
 *		- A vector of items that contains all goods for sale
 *		- A vector of strings passed as an argument to the menu function 
 *		  to create a purchase menu
 *
 *		Functions inherited from parent Space class include:
 *		- Accessor and mutator methods for all space pointers
 *		- Accessor methods for space name, number, and description
 *		
 *		Public member functions of this class include:
 *		- A constructor and destructor
 *		- The implementation of the interact function (a pure virtual function in the
 *		parent class)
 *
 *		In addition, this class has a private member function
 *		called by the constructor to intialize the purchase menu.

/*************************************************************************************************** 
 * Description: Default constructor for Forum object.
 *
 * 		Calls Space constructor and passes it a string indicating a space's name, 
 * 		an int indicating its number on the map, and a string with the name of a 
 * 		.txt file containing its description. 
 * 		Space constructor then sets the name and num to the parameters received.
 * 		Opens input file and reads description into description data member.
 * 		Sets all space pointers to nullptr since the mutator methods will
 * 		later be used to set those pointers once all spaces have been created.
 *
 * 		Forum constructor also initializes private data members (vectors),
 * 		calling private make_purchase_menu() function for
 * 		assistance with making the menu.

/*************************************************************************************************** 
 * Description: Virtual function that implements pure virtual "interact" function
 * 		defined in parent class. Since function signature must be identical
 * 		in all child classes in order to override the parent class pure virtual function,
 * 		all child classes' interact functions receive the same seven paremeters passed by
 * 		the Game class. All parameters are passed by reference so that the 
 * 		interact functions can change them as needed (they all have return type of void 
 * 		but may need to change multiple parameters of multiple types). 
 * 		Not every child class uses all seven parameters, but each
 * 		parameter is used by at least one child class. The parameters are listed below,
 * 		with a # symbol before and after each one used by this particular class:
 *		
 *		# - a set of strings indicating the items in the player's satchel #
 *		# - an int indicating how much money the player has #
 *		  - an int indicating how many steps the player has taken since bathing 
 *		  - a bool indicating whether or not the player has bathed 
 *		  - a bool indicating whether or not the player knows about the scroll that
 *		    the librarian wants to be returned 
 *		  - a bool indicating whether or not the player is still alive
 *		  - a bool indicating whether or not the player is with Nero 
 *
 *		The Forum's implementation of this function does the following:
 *		- Allows the user to purchase items if they have enough money
 *		  to purchase a given item, their satchel has space, and they
 *		  do not already have that item.
 *		- User can buy multiple items in one stop. They must choose to exit the Forum.
