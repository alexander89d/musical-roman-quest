 * Program Name: finalProjMain.cpp
 * Author: Alexander Densmore
 * Date: 12/3/18
 * Description: This program implements a game with linked spaces that is set in Ancient Rome. 
 * 		The board is a 3 x 3 grid of 9 spaces, each space being of a different type. The user takes on 
 * 		the role of a time traveler who has gone to Ancient Rome to research Roman music (although it 
 * 		is known that Roman music existed, little is known about what it would have actually sounded 
 * 		like). The user must visit the emperor Nero for dinner, record him singing, and get a copy 
 * 		of written music from him. However, there are challenges the user must overcome before they 
 * 		will be given permission to visit Nero. They have 75 total steps to go between the spaces, 
 * 		complete the tasks, and collect the items necessary to get an audience with Nero. 
 * 		The user must be careful, because certain actions (such as fighting gladiator battles) 
 * 		could result in their characterÂ’s death and the end of the game regardless of the number of 
 * 		steps taken so far.
