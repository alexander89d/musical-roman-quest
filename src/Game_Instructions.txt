		A Musical Roman Quest		by Alexander Densmore

*** Instructions ***

Hello time traveler, and welcome to Ancient Rome! You have been sent back in time to investigate Ancient Roman music.
While we know that Ancient Romans had music, we only have theories as to what it actually sounded like.
That is where you come in! Your task is to befriend the emperor, Nero, record him singing, and bring sheet music
back to the present-day United States with you.

Here are a few things you should know before you begin roaming around Rome:
#
You have been sent to the time of Nero because, while he is an eccentric emperor who can be a little violent
and unpredictable, he has a passion for the arts. He loves performing for an audience, and he can use his authority
to get you a copy of sheet music from the library to take back home with you. Usually, you can only look at music in
the library, but they will of course make an exception for the emperor. Just be careful what you say to Nero or his 
supporters, and above all else, do not even think about criticizing his singing, no matter what it sounds like.

The map of the city is shown below:

 --------------- --------------- ---------------

You will start in Square V (the Forum). 
You can buy goods in the Forum, but you don't have any money yet, so you should go
explore other squares to see where you can get some money.
#
Your current location will be indicated on the map by an asterisk centered in the bottom of the square
where you are located. It will also be printed at the top of the screen.

On any turn, you can choose to either enter the area where you are located to complete some task,
or you can simply "pass through" that area and choose the direction of the square where you would
like to go next (North, Northeast, East, Southeast, etc.). You can only move from one square to a square immediately touching it,
and you cannot move off the edge of the map. Thefore, you can go to all 8 other squares from Square V (The Forum), 
but you can only go to 3 other squares from Square I (the Bibliotheca).
#
Every time you move from one square to another, 1 step will be added to the number of steps you have moved 
(regardless of whether you entered the current space where you are located and completed a task or simply passed through it).
Be careful! You can only take 75 steps total before arriving at Nero's palace for dinner. If you have not been received by Nero
before taking 75 steps, that means you will be out in Rome at night on your own. We certainly don't want you in that
dangerous situation, so we will automatically force you back into the present time if you hit 75 steps.

Speaking of being careful... even during the day, things can get dangerous in Rome. Be careful what you say to people or
what battles you choose to fight. Remember that you are mortal and are about to interact with real Romans who have real swords.
#
Enough with these warnings, though - you are here to do valuable and fascinating research!
Have fun, and, as the Romans would say, bona fortuna (good luck)!
