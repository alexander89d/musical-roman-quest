Enter the adrenaline-rush that is the Roman Colosseum! Fight battles against gladiators!
Win 10 coins if you win the match! Warning - if you lose, you are at the mercy of the presiding senator.
The senator will choose if you live or die, so be warned of the possible consequences of gladitorial combat.

Rules: Gladitorial battles work like the game of rock-paper-scissors. Each turn, you can choose 1 of 3 moves:
shield, net, or sword. Shield beats sword, sword beats net, and net beats shield.
